            <article>
                <h3>"A Brief History of Cricket"</h3>
                <p>Cricket originated in England in the late 16th century, with the earliest known reference to the game dating back to 1598. By the 18th century, it had become a popular sport in England, leading to the formation of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in 1787, which established many of the game's fundamental rules. The first international match was played between Canada and the United States in 1844. The International Cricket Council (ICC), founded in 1909, began overseeing international cricket competitions. Test cricket, the oldest form of the game, began in 1877 with matches between England and Australia. The sport's global expansion continued throughout the 20th century, leading to the establishment of various international tournaments and the growth of professional leagues.</p>
